# Internship-Project
This project involves segmenting customers based on their demographic and behavioral data using the K-Means clustering algorithm. As the owner of a supermarket, the goal is to understand the different groups of customers to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project contains hypothetical customer data with the following features:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Customer Gender: Gender of the customer.
Customer Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income: Annual income of the customer (in thousand dollars).
Spending Score: A score assigned to the customer based on their behavior and spending nature.
# Objective
The primary objective is to segment the customers into distinct groups based on their similarities in the provided features. This segmentation will help in understanding customer demographics and behavior, enabling targeted marketing and personalized services.

# Approach
# Data Preprocessing:

Load and explore the dataset.
Handle any missing values if present.
Encode categorical variables (Gender).
Standardize/normalize the features for better clustering performance.
K-Means Clustering:

Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment the customers.
Visualize the clusters to interpret the results.
# Analysis and Interpretation:

Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.
Provide insights and recommendations for each segment based on their demographics and spending behavior.
